# TransportBelt Visualizer
---


TransportBelt Visualizer is a robust and intuitive Windows Forms application designed with the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern.
This application is primarily used to render and visualize images representing transport belts in a highly interactive and user-friendly interface.


The application's main feature is its ability to generate a visual representation of transport belts.
These visualizations can be used to understand the layout and operation of transport belts in various contexts, such as manufacturing, logistics, and warehousing.
